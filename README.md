# JavaScript Quiz - John Zigterman

## Description

- I attempted to create a rudimentary, button based JavaScript quiz.
- A set of arrays may contain any number of questions with four answers each to be presented as buttons.
- When the correct answer is clicked, the user's score increments.
- When the incorrect answer is clicked, the user loses time to complete the quiz.
- The user is presented with their score when the quiz is complete, and they may log it to the high score board.

## Installation

This is a web application that can be used with any web browser.

## Usage

This application can be used to assess if the user has rudimentary JavaScript knowledge and help them improve on that knowledge.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
